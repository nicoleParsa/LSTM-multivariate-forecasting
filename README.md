# hourly-airpollution-forecast
Applying and evaluating various time series prediction methods to forecast hourly rate of air pollution.

# project description
The objective of this project is to apply and evaluate various time series forecasting techniques to forecast hourly rate of air pollution. This is a not a traditional univariate forecasting problem, as there are covariates in the data that can be utilised to produce more accurate forecasts. As such, I will be looking at some more advanced methods of time series forecasting, including \

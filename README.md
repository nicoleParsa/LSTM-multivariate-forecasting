# hourly-airpollution-forecast
Applying and evaluating LSTM for time series forecasting.

# project description
The objective of this project is to apply and evaluate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks to forecast hourly rate of air pollution. This is a not a traditional univariate forecasting problem, as there are covariates in the data that can be utilised to produce more accurate forecasts.
